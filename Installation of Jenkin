#sudo apt-get install wget && sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key && echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null && sudo apt install ca-certificates && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install jenkins && systemctl enable  jenkins && systemctl start jenkins

#You also need to add Jenkins service to run with the firewall and add its exception so that it is available to access from the outside world. Finally, we need to reload the firewall service for the changes to take effect.

# firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent && firewall-cmd --reload

To check the firewall status and accessible ports, use the firewall-cmd command:
# firewall-cmd --list-all

Access to the web page follows: http://localhost:8080
